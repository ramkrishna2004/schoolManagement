# Announcement Management System Design

## Overview
The Announcement Management System allows admins to broadcast important messages to students and teachers. It supports scheduling, visibility control, and role-based access.

## 1. Announcement Management Functionalities

### For Admin:
- **Create Announcements:** Broadcast messages to all/selected users
- **Edit/Delete Announcements:** Manage existing announcements
- **Schedule Visibility:** Set visibleFrom and visibleTo dates
- **Target Audience:** Choose target (all, students, teachers)

### For Teacher/Student:
- **View Announcements:** See relevant announcements on dashboard

## 2. Components Structure

### Backend Components:
```
server/
├── models/
│   └── Announcement.js         # Announcement data model
├── controllers/
│   └── announcementController.js # Announcement business logic
├── routes/
│   └── announcementRoutes.js   # Announcement API endpoints
```

### Frontend Components:
```
client/src/
├── components/
│   └── AnnouncementList.js     # Announcement listing
├── pages/
│   └── AnnouncementPage.js     # Announcement management page
```

## 3. Data Model

### Announcement Model (server/models/Announcement.js):
```javascript
{
  title: String,           // Announcement title
  message: String,         // Announcement message
  createdBy: ObjectId,     // Reference to Admin
  target: String,          // all, students, teachers
  visibleFrom: Date,       // Start of visibility
  visibleTo: Date,         // End of visibility
  isActive: Boolean,       // Active flag
  adminId: ObjectId        // Reference to Admin
}
```

## 4. Data Flow

### Announcement Creation Flow:
1. **Admin** fills announcement form
2. **Frontend** validates input
3. **FormData** sent to backend
4. **Backend** creates announcement record
5. **Frontend** updates announcement list

### Permission Flow:
- **Admin:** Full access to all announcements
- **Teacher/Student:** View relevant announcements

## 5. Page Flow

### Admin Page Flow:
```
Dashboard → Announcements → [List/Add/Edit/Delete]
├── Announcement List
├── Add/Edit Announcement
├── Delete Announcement
```

### Teacher/Student Page Flow:
```
Dashboard → Announcements → [View]
├── View Announcements
```

## 6. API Endpoints
- `GET /api/announcements` - Get announcements
- `POST /api/announcements` - Add announcement
- `PUT /api/announcements/:id` - Update announcement
- `DELETE /api/announcements/:id` - Delete announcement

## 7. Security & Validation
- Role-based permissions
- Input validation
- Visibility window enforcement

## 8. Future Enhancements
- Push/email notifications
- Announcement read tracking
- Targeted announcements by class/group
